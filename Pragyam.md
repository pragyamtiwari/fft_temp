## India's 'One Nation, One Election' Drive

### Modi government pushes electoral reform to synchronize national and state polls, sparking federalism concerns.

### What's happening: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are championing the "One Nation, One Election" (ONOE) initiative. It proposes holding Lok Sabha (national) and all state legislative assembly elections concurrently. The goal is to conduct these synchronized polls every five years.

### What's the context: India's electoral cycle is currently staggered across states, leading to near-constant campaigning. This frequent activity imposes the Model Code of Conduct, limiting government policy work. Historically, simultaneous elections were practiced in India during the 1950s and 1960s but ceased.

### Why it matters: Proponents suggest ONOE could significantly reduce the financial burden of elections. It aims to improve governance efficiency by allowing governments to focus on development. This initiative might also foster greater political stability by potentially reducing mid-term polls.

### What's next: Implementing ONOE necessitates multiple constitutional amendments and broad support from states. Overcoming significant logistical challenges and achieving political consensus among diverse parties are crucial. A synchronized electoral roll is also part of the broader reform push.

### TL;DR: India's BJP-led government is advocating for simultaneous national and state elections to enhance efficiency, a proposal facing significant constitutional and political challenges.


## Elon Musk Announces Formation of "America Party"

### Billionaire's move aims to challenge the entrenched two-party system, following a public disagreement with Donald Trump.

### What's happening: Elon Musk recently announced the formation of a new political party called the "America Party." He stated its goal is to "give you back your freedom" and challenge the entrenched two-party system. The announcement was made on social media platform X.

### What's the context: Musk's announcement follows a public falling out with former President Donald Trump. Musk had previously supported Trump but opposed his sweeping tax cuts law, criticizing its impact on the national deficit. The party aims to focus on specific Congressional seats and emphasizes pro-Second Amendment and pro-Bitcoin stances.

### Why it matters: The U.S. political system has been dominated by two major parties for over 160 years, making third-party success historically difficult. Musk's wealth and influence offer a unique platform, but experts remain skeptical about the party's long-term viability. The America Party could potentially split conservative votes, which might inadvertently benefit Democrats under the current electoral system.

### What's next: It remains unclear if formal steps have been taken to legally establish the America Party or outline its detailed policies. The next 12 months will be critical to see if the party can organize effectively and gain ballot access. Its success or failure will have important implications for American political competition.

### TL;DR: Elon Musk announced the "America Party" to challenge the U.S. two-party system following a break with Donald Trump. The party faces significant hurdles to become an influential force.


## African Startups See Significant Funding Rebound in H1 2025

### Investment across the continent surged to over $1.3 billion, marking a strong recovery from previous declines.

### What's happening: African startups secured approximately $1.35 to $1.4 billion in H1 2025, an 78% to 86% increase from the same period in 2024. This rebound was led by strong equity funding and a notable rise in debt financing, including a significant $137 million deal for Senegalese fintech Wave. The "Big Four" ecosystems, particularly Egypt, continue to dominate, with 238 startups raising over $100,000.

### What's the context: This funding resurgence follows a challenging 2023 and early 2024 period, marked by global economic uncertainties and cautious venture capital activity. Startups adapted by prioritizing unit economics, profitability, and sustainable growth over rapid expansion. The ecosystem now benefits from diversified funding sources and potential regulatory improvements, such as Ghana's proposed Startups Bill.

### Why it matters: The rebound signals renewed investor confidence in African startups after a period of funding contraction. Increased funding, especially in equity and debt, supports the growth and scaling of startups, enabling them to expand operations, innovate, and create jobs. A rise in successful exits indicates maturation of the ecosystem, which could provide returns to investors and potentially encourage further investment.

### What's next: If current momentum continues, 2025 could potentially surpass previous years in total funding, supporting the emergence of more African unicorns. The ecosystem may experience increased competition for capital, driving startups to demonstrate stronger business fundamentals. Future funding dynamics could also be influenced by political events and global economic conditions, including U.S. interest rate policies.

### TL;DR: African startups raised over $1.3 billion in H1 2025, an 80% increase from 2024, signaling renewed investor confidence and ecosystem maturation after a funding downturn.
